Digital wallet for loyalty cards
It is an application whose idea is to facilitate and increase the use of loyalty cards in the purchase process.
The application has simple navigation. Screen where it represents the electronic wallet where all scanned cards are listed.
A screen that displays all the choices of merchants from which the user chooses which card he has and scans it with the help of the camera. 
Screen for adding a new merchant that does not exist in the Global Warehouse. 
And the well-known settings section for additional information.
Once the user has filled their wallet, with just one click on the card the barcode/qr code from the card appears. 
And the second nicer functionality is that the application suggests a card code and sorts all the other scanned cards according to our current location. 
That way, saving time in finding the card we need, we just open the application and the alert window appears with the barcode/qr code from the merchant where we are currently.
